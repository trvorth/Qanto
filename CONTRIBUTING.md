# **Contributing to Qanto**

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Qanto. It's people like you that make open source great. We welcome all contributions, from fixing typos in the documentation to implementing major new features.  
To ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process for everyone involved, please read through these guidelines before you start.

## **Code of Conduct**

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Qanto Code of Conduct](http://github.com/trvorth/qanto/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## **How Can I Contribute?**

There are many ways to contribute, and not all of them involve writing code.

* **Reporting Bugs**: If you find a bug, please open a detailed issue. Include steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, and what you are observing instead.  
* **Suggesting Enhancements**: Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Open an issue with the "enhancement" label to start a discussion with the community.  
* **Improving Documentation**: Good documentation is key. If you find something that is unclear, incorrect, or could be improved, please feel free to submit a pull request.  
* **Submitting Pull Requests**: If you have a bug fix or a new feature you'd like to implement, we'd love to see it.

## **Your First Code Contribution**

Unsure where to begin? A great place to start is by looking for issues tagged good first issue or help wanted. These are issues that have been identified as good entry points for new contributors.

### **Pull Request Process**

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from main.  
2. If you've added code that should be tested, **add tests**.  
3. Ensure the test suite passes (cargo test).  
4. Make sure your code lints (cargo clippy and cargo fmt).  
5. Issue that pull request\!

## **Styleguides**

### **Git Commit Messages**

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").  
* Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").  
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.  
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### **Rust Styleguide**

We adhere to the standard Rust formatting guidelines enforced by rustfmt. Please ensure your code is formatted with cargo fmt before submitting. cargo clippy should also be run to catch common mistakes and improve code quality.  
Thank you for helping us build the future of decentralized technology\!
