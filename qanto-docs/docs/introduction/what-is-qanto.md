# What is Qanto?

Qanto is a revolutionary Layer-0 blockchain platform that combines cutting-edge technologies to create the most advanced distributed ledger system available today. Built from the ground up with post-quantum security, AI governance, and unparalleled scalability, Qanto represents the next evolution in blockchain technology.

## Core Innovations

### 1. **DAG-Based Architecture**
Unlike traditional linear blockchains, Qanto employs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure that enables:
- **Parallel Transaction Processing**: Multiple transactions can be confirmed simultaneously
- **Near-Instant Finality**: Transactions achieve finality in seconds, not minutes
- **Unlimited Scalability**: The network grows stronger with more participants

### 2. **SAGA AI Governance**
The Self-Adaptive Governance AI (SAGA) system represents a paradigm shift in blockchain governance:
- **Autonomous Parameter Optimization**: Network parameters adjust in real-time based on conditions
- **Predictive Threat Detection**: AI-powered security that anticipates and prevents attacks
- **Economic Stability**: Dynamic fee adjustment and reward distribution for optimal network health

### 3. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
Qanto is built to withstand the quantum computing revolution:
- **ML-DSA Signatures**: Lattice-based signatures resistant to quantum attacks
- **Future-Proof Security**: Designed to protect assets for decades to come
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines classical and post-quantum algorithms for defense in depth

### 4. **HAME Economic Model**
The Holistic Adaptive Market Economy ensures sustainable growth:
- **Dynamic Inflation Control**: Automatically adjusts token emission based on network activity
- **Fair Distribution**: Rewards aligned with actual contribution to network security
- **Anti-Manipulation**: AI-driven detection and prevention of economic attacks
