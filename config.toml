# Qanto Node Configuration
#
# This file configures the Qanto node's behavior, from network settings to
# consensus parameters. It's designed for high-throughput and flexible deployments.

# --- Network Configuration ---
# The p2p_address is a multiaddress that specifies the node's listening address
# for peer-to-peer communication. It can be any valid libp2p multiaddress,
# supporting various protocols like TCP, QUIC, etc.
p2p_address = "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8001"

# The local_full_p2p_address is the node's full multiaddress, including its PeerId.
# This value is automatically generated and saved on first startup.
# Example: "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8001/p2p/12D3KooWJXhhf8xDm8XH1CSBjLbemw7H384NQZwuexiRvqqFgZhC"

# The api_address specifies the listening address for the node's HTTP API.
# It can be any valid socket address.
api_address = "127.0.0.1:8081"

# The network_id is a unique identifier for the Qanto network.
# Nodes with different network_ids will not connect to each other.
network_id = "qanto-local-testnet"

# The peers list contains the multiaddresses of other nodes to connect to on startup.
peers = []

# --- Consensus & DAG Configuration ---
# The genesis_validator is the public key of the first validator in the network.

# The target_block_time is the desired time between blocks in milliseconds.
# A lower value will result in higher throughput, but may increase the number of forks.
# 31ms = ~32 blocks per second.

# The difficulty is the initial difficulty of the Proof-of-Work algorithm.
difficulty = 2

# The max_amount is the maximum amount of tokens that can be created.

# --- Performance & Hardware ---
# Set to true to enable GPU mining.

# Set to true to enable ZK-proof generation and verification.

# The number of threads to use for mining.

# --- Sharding & Scaling ---
# The initial number of chains (shards) in the QantoDAG.
# More chains can increase parallelism and throughput.

# --- Logging & P2P Internals ---
[logging]
# The logging level for the node.
# Can be "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", or "error".
level = "info"

[p2p]
# The heartbeat interval in milliseconds for the gossipsub protocol.
