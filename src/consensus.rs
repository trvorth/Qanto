//! --- Hyperchain Hybrid Consensus Engine ---
//! v2.0.0 - Hardened & Adaptive
//!
//! This module implements the core consensus rules for the Hyperchain network.
//! It uses a hybrid model that combines three critical, non-replaceable mechanisms,
//! each serving a distinct and vital purpose.
//!
//! 1.  **Proof-of-Stake (PoS): The "Right to Participate"**. This is the foundational
//!     layer for eligibility. To create blocks, a node must be a registered validator
//!     with a minimum amount of HCN tokens staked. This ensures that block producers
//!     have a financial "stake" in the network's success and are disincentivized from
//!     acting maliciously. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite for block production.
//!
//! 2.  **Proof-of-Work (PoW): The "Cost of Truth"**. This is the fundamental security
//!     and finality layer. Every valid block, regardless of who creates it, MUST contain
//!     a valid Proof-of-Work solution (a nonce that results in a block hash below a
//!     certain target). This makes rewriting history computationally expensive and secures
//!     the chain against 51% attacks. PoW is a permanent and core part of the consensus
//!     mechanism that cannot be bypassed.
//!
//! 3.  **Proof-of-Sentiency (PoSe): The "Intelligence Layer"**. This is Hyperchain's
//!     novel innovation, powered by the SAGA pallet. PoSe does NOT replace PoW.
//!     Instead, it *dynamically adjusts the PoW difficulty target* for each miner
//!     based on their reputation (Saga Credit Score - SCS). Reputable, trusted miners
//!     face a lower difficulty, making the network highly efficient and reducing its
//!     energy footprint. Malicious or untrusted miners face a much higher difficulty,
//!     making attacks prohibitively expensive. PoSe makes PoW smarter, adaptive, and
//!     more secure, ensuring the most trustworthy participants are the most efficient.
