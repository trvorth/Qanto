//! --- Hyperchain Hybrid Consensus Engine ---
//! v1.0.0 - Hybrid PoW/PoS/PoSe (Hardened & Eco-Sentiency Aware)
//! This module implements the core consensus rules for the Hyperchain network.
//! It uses a hybrid model that combines three critical, non-replaceable mechanisms:
//!
//! 1.  **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** The foundational layer for eligibility. To be eligible
//!     to create blocks, a node must be a registered validator with a minimum amount of
//!     HCN tokens staked. This ensures that block producers have a financial "stake"
//!     in the network's success and are disincentivized from acting maliciously. This is a
//!     non-negotiable prerequisite for block production.
//!
//! 2.  **Proof-of-Work (PoW):** The fundamental security and finality layer. Every valid block,
//!     regardless of who creates it, MUST contain a valid Proof-of-Work solution (a nonce
//!     that results in a block hash below a certain target). This makes rewriting history
//!     computationally expensive and secures the chain against 51% attacks. PoW is a
//!     permanent and core part of the consensus mechanism that cannot be bypassed.
//!
//! 3.  **Proof-of-Sentiency (PoSe):** The intelligence and efficiency layer. This is
//!     Hyperchain's novel innovation, powered by the SAGA pallet. PoSe does NOT replace
//!     PoW. Instead, it *dynamically adjusts the PoW difficulty target* for each miner
//!     based on their reputation (Saga Credit Score - SCS). Reputable, trusted miners
//!     face a lower difficulty, making the network highly efficient and reducing its
//!     energy footprint. Malicious or untrusted miners face a much higher difficulty,
//!     making attacks prohibitively expensive. PoSe makes PoW smarter, adaptive, and
//!     more secure.
