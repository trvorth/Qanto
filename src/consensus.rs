//! --- Qanto Hybrid Consensus Engine ---
//! v2.1.0 - User-Specified Finality Model
//!
//! This module implements the core consensus rules for the Qanto network.
//! It uses a hybrid model where finality is determined by a combination of PoW and PoS,
//! with PoW as the primary mechanism.
//!
//! ### Finality Model (As per Specification)
//!
//! 1.  **Proof-of-Work (PoW): The "Primary Finality"**. This is the fundamental security
//!     and default finality layer. Every valid block MUST contain a valid Proof-of-Work
//!     solution. The cumulative work on a chain of blocks is the primary determinant of its finality,
//!     making history computationally expensive to rewrite.
//!
//! 2.  **Proof-of-Stake (PoS): The "Finality Helper"**. This mechanism helps accelerate the
//!     appearance of finality and signals validator confidence. It is **NOT** a strict requirement
//!     for a block to be valid. A block with valid PoW but low stake is still considered
//!     valid, though it may be flagged as having lower PoS-backed confidence. Validators
//!     are **NO LONGER REQUIRED** to have a minimum stake to produce blocks.
//!
//! 3.  **Proof-of-Sentiency (PoSe): The "Intelligence Layer"**. Powered by the SAGA
//!     pallet, PoSe makes the primary PoW mechanism "smarter" by dynamically adjusting
//!     the PoW difficulty for each miner based on their reputation (Saga Credit Score - SCS).
//!     This makes the network more efficient and secure without replacing PoW.
