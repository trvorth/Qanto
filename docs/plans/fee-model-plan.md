# Qanto Blockchain Fee Model

## Overview

The Qanto blockchain implements a sophisticated fee model designed to optimize network efficiency, prevent spam, and ensure fair resource allocation while maintaining ultra-low transaction costs. This document outlines the complete fee structure, calculation methods, and economic incentives.

## Core Principles

### 1. Efficiency-First Design
- **Ultra-low base fees**: Minimal cost for standard transactions
- **Dynamic pricing**: Fees adjust based on network congestion
- **Batch optimization**: Reduced per-transaction costs for batched operations

### 2. Fair Resource Allocation
- **Computational complexity**: Fees scale with resource usage
- **Storage costs**: Proportional to data storage requirements
- **Network bandwidth**: Fees reflect network resource consumption

### 3. Spam Prevention
- **Minimum viable fees**: Prevent zero-cost spam attacks
- **Progressive pricing**: Higher fees for excessive usage patterns
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

## Fee Structure

### Base Transaction Fee

```
Base Fee = 0.0001 QANTO (100 microQANTO)
```

The base fee covers:
- Basic transaction validation
- Network propagation
- Minimal storage requirements
- Standard computational overhead

### Dynamic Fee Components

#### 1. Congestion Multiplier
```
Congestion Multiplier = max(1.0, current_tps / target_tps * adjustment_factor)

Where:
- target_tps = 10,000,000
- adjustment_factor = 0.5 (configurable)
- current_tps = network's current transaction rate
```

#### 2. Complexity Fee
```
Complexity Fee = base_fee * complexity_score

Complexity Score Calculation:
- Simple transfer: 1.0x
- Smart contract call: 1.5x - 5.0x (based on gas usage)
- Multi-signature: 1.2x per additional signature
- Cross-chain operation: 2.0x
- Privacy transaction: 3.0x
```

#### 3. Storage Fee
```
Storage Fee = data_size_bytes * storage_rate_per_byte

Storage Rates:
- Temporary data (< 1 block): 0.000001 QANTO/byte
- Short-term data (< 1000 blocks): 0.000005 QANTO/byte
- Permanent data: 0.00001 QANTO/byte
```

#### 4. Priority Fee (Optional)
```
Priority Fee = user_defined_amount

Benefits:
- Faster transaction inclusion
- Higher processing priority
- Guaranteed execution in next block (if sufficient)
```

### Total Transaction Fee Formula

```
Total Fee = (Base Fee + Complexity Fee + Storage Fee) * Congestion Multiplier + Priority Fee
```

## Fee Categories

### 1. Standard Transactions

#### Simple Transfer
```
Fee Components:

- Total: ~0.0053 QANTO
```

## Dynamic Fee Adjustment

### Congestion-Based Pricing

The network automatically adjusts fees based on current congestion levels:

```python
def calculate_congestion_multiplier(current_tps, target_tps=10_000_000):
    if current_tps <= target_tps * 0.7:
        return 1.0  # Normal fees
    elif current_tps <= target_tps:
        return 1.0 + (current_tps - target_tps * 0.7) / (target_tps * 0.3) * 0.5
    else:
        # Exponential increase for overload conditions
        overload_factor = current_tps / target_tps
        return 1.5 * (overload_factor ** 2)
```

### Fee Prediction

Users can predict fees using the network's fee estimation API:

```json
{
  "estimated_fee": {
    "base_fee": "0.0001",
    "complexity_fee": "0.00005",
    "storage_fee": "0.000032",
    "congestion_multiplier": 1.2,
    "total_estimated": "0.000098",
    "confidence": 95,
    "valid_for_blocks": 10
  }
}
```

## Fee Distribution

### Validator Rewards
```
Validator Share: 70% of total fees
- Block proposer: 40% of validator share
- Block validators: 60% of validator share (distributed proportionally)
```

### Network Development Fund
```
Development Fund: 20% of total fees
- Protocol development: 60%
- Security audits: 25%
- Community grants: 15%
```

### Burn Mechanism
```
Fee Burn: 10% of total fees
- Deflationary pressure on QANTO supply
- Long-term value preservation
- Economic sustainability
```

## Gas Model Compatibility

### Ethereum Compatibility
Qanto maintains compatibility with Ethereum's gas model for smart contracts:

```
Qanto Gas Price = ethereum_gas_price * conversion_factor
Conversion Factor = 0.001 (1000x cheaper than Ethereum)

Example:
- Ethereum gas price: 20 Gwei
- Qanto equivalent: 0.02 Gwei
- Simple transfer: ~21,000 gas = 0.00042 QANTO
```

### Gas Optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple operations in single transaction
- **State Rent**: Temporary storage with automatic cleanup
- **Compression**: Automatic data compression for storage

## Economic Incentives

### Validator Economics
```
Expected Daily Revenue (per validator):
- Base rewards: 50 QANTO/day
- Fee rewards: Variable (10-100 QANTO/day based on network usage)
- Total APY: 15-25% (estimated)
```

### User Benefits
- **Predictable Costs**: Stable fee structure with clear calculations
- **Batch Discounts**: Reduced per-transaction costs for batched operations
- **Priority Options**: Optional fast-track processing
- **Fee Caps**: Maximum fee limits to prevent unexpected costs

## Fee Optimization Strategies

### For Users

#### 1. Batch Transactions
```
Single Transaction Fee: 0.0001 QANTO each
Batch of 10 Transactions: 0.0008 QANTO total (20% discount)
Batch of 100 Transactions: 0.007 QANTO total (30% discount)
```

#### 2. Off-Peak Usage
```
Peak Hours (high congestion): 1.5x - 3.0x multiplier
Off-Peak Hours: 1.0x multiplier (standard fees)
Optimal timing can reduce costs by 50-70%
```

#### 3. Storage Optimization
```
Minimize Data Storage:
- Use references instead of full data
- Implement data compression
- Utilize temporary storage for ephemeral data
```

### For Developers

#### 1. Smart Contract Optimization
```solidity
// Optimized contract patterns
contract OptimizedContract {
    // Pack structs to minimize storage
    struct PackedData {
        uint128 value1;
        uint128 value2;
    }
    
    // Use events for non-critical data
    event DataLogged(uint256 indexed id, bytes32 hash);
    
    // Batch operations
    function batchProcess(uint256[] calldata ids) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
            // Process each ID
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Gas Estimation
```javascript
// Accurate gas estimation
const gasEstimate = await contract.estimateGas.method(params);
const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
const totalCost = gasEstimate * gasPrice;
```
