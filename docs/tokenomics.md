## Vesting Model

- **Team**: 2–3 years vesting, 6–12 month cliff, monthly unlocks thereafter.  
- **Investors**: Linear vesting over 2 years, no cliff.  
- **Testnet Contributors**: 6-month vest after TGE.  
- **Community & Mining Rewards**: Released gradually through consensus emissions, later shifting toward fee-based rewards.

## Economic Sustainability

- **Adaptive Issuance**: Initially inflationary to bootstrap participation, transitioning to fee-driven sustainability.  
- **SAGA AI**: Automatically adjusts reward rates, inflation, and fees to maintain network health and decentralization.
