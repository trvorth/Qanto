# Qanto Tokenomics

**Total Supply: 21,000,000,000 QAN**

Qantoâ€™s tokenomics are designed for fairness, sustainability, and decentralization, while ensuring enough resources for long-term growth. Qanto's tokenomics live along with one core principle: **the community comes first**. We are committed to a fair launch, with no pre-mine, no venture capitalist allocations, and no team tokens. This is a project for the builders, the creators, and the believers in a truly decentralized world.

Guiding Principles

**Fair Launch**: Everyone has the same opportunity to acquire QAN from the beginning. The core contributors will be funded through the community-governed Ecosystem & Development Fund, just like any other developer or contributor. This ensures accountability and long-term alignment. There are no pre-sale or private-sale investors who can dump on the market. Everyone starts on a level playing field.

**Community Ownership**: The vast majority of tokens are distributed directly to the community.

**Sustainable Growth**: A built-in, transparent mechanism for funding long-term development.

**Decentralization**: No single entity controls a significant portion of the token supply.

## Distribution

| Category                                | Percentage | Allocation Details |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| Community (mining / public / rewards)   | 80%     | Open participation via PoW, DPoS, and AI-guided rewards. |
| Ecosystem & Development Fund            | 15%     | A community-governed treasury to fund grants, partnerships, and future protocol development. All funds are subject to a multi-year vesting schedule. |
| Public Liquidity                        | 5%      | Used to provide initial liquidity on decentralized exchanges and for a public sale, accessible to all. |

## Vesting Model

- **Ecosystem & Development Fund**: Tokens are vested over 2 years, with a 1-year cliff, ensuring a long-term commitment to the project's success.
- **Public Liquidity**: Locked in a smart contract to provide a stable and secure market for QAN.
- **Testnet Contributors**: 3-month vest after TGE.  
- **Community & Mining Rewards**: Released gradually through consensus emissions, later shifting toward fee-based rewards.

## Economic Sustainability

- **Adaptive Issuance**: Initially inflationary to bootstrap participation, transitioning to fee-driven sustainability.  
- **SAGA AI**: Automatically adjusts reward rates, inflation, and fees to maintain network health and decentralization.  
- **Fair-Launch Ethos**: No pre-mine, no insider advantage before testnet, no team allocation, no VC or Private Investor Allocation
- **Transparent Funding**: A small, protocol-level developer fee from network transactions will be directed to the Ecosystem & Development Fund. This is a sustainable and transparent way to fund the project's growth without relying on a pre-mined treasury.

## Summary

This is not just another token; it's an invitation to be a part of a movement. By putting 80% of the tokens in the hands of the community, we are ensuring that Qanto will be a project by the people, for the people. We believe this is the only way to build a truly decentralized and successful ecosystem.

Join us, and let's build the future together.
