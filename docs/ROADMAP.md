### **Strategic Outlook & Next Steps**:

1.  **Finalize Phase 1**: The immediate priority is to move from a local simulation to a Public Testnet. This involves deploying at least one stable seed node, providing clear instructions for community members to join, and monitoring network stability and performance.
2.  **Documentation**: Concurrently, develop a comprehensive Whitepaper and developer documentation. Explain the unique value proposition of the SAGA AI, the ISNM/PoSe model, and the tiered fee structure. This is non-negotiable for attracting a community and validators.
3.  **Community Building**: Start building a community around the project now. Use the whitepaper and the promise of the upcoming public testnet to generate interest on platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram.
4.  **Security Audit**: Once the testnet is stable, engage a reputable security firm to audit the codebase. This will be a major catalyst for building trust.
