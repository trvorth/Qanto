# Qanto Optimization Strategies

## Overview
Strategies to reduce resource consumption while preserving core principles.

## Key Strategies
1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement native async for network and I/O to minimize CPU wait times.
2. **Efficient Data Structures**: Use optimized caches and trees for memory reduction.
3. **QanHash Integration**: Develop QanHash-based compression for storage and bandwidth efficiency.
4. **Feature Completion**: Address TODOs with professional implementations.
5. **Warning Resolution**: Fix any remaining unused warnings.

## Alignment with Goals
All strategies maintain decentralization, untraceability, and Layer-0 features.
